Hello repo viewers! This Ecoguardian repo is the code for an environmental whistleblower web app.  
This app is developed under the Python Django framework and is deployed using Heroku. It was a group project from UVA CS3240 (Advanced Software Development Essential).  
In this project, me and my teammates  
Developed the full stack “Ecoguardian” web application under Python Django framework.  
Contributed to requirements elicitation and specification, feature design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.  
Used tools and APIs like, cloud storage (Amazon S3), Postgres SQL database, Google Oauth, Google Map etc. in system and feature design.  
Containerized the application and deployed it to Heroku, ensuring scalable and reliable service delivery.  
Finished the application that allowed users to report (with accounts or anonymously) environmental damage incidents and receive incidents updates and provided a portal for environment authorities to manage incidents.  
Hope you have fun using this app!
